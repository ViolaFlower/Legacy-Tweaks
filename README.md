Inspired by Adrenix's [Nostalgic Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/nostalgic-tweaks) and Wilyicaro's [Legacy4J](https://modrinth.com/mod/legacy4j), Legacy Tweaks takes many old Legacy Console Edition features and brings them to Java Edition.

Legacy Tweaks contains over 30 tweaks as of 0.1.0, including everything from GUIs, tool-tips, gameplay features, to even recreations of old LCE version menus!

## ‚ùì Why Over Legacy4J
Legacy4J was built as an all-in-one LCE re-creation. While that may seem like a good choice at first glance, it has caused a very bloated and rigid experienc. Customization and compatibility are some of Legacy4J's worse aspects, not to mention a 15% performance drop and rise in stutters between vanilla MC and the mod. Many fans in the community have been wanting a way to customize aspects of the game and the developers have decided not to. And even mod creators have been scared away from compatibility due to the horrendous spaghetti code Legacy4J was built on. 

Overall, Legacy Edition Tweaks has been designed to do away with the issues that had plagued Legacy4J since the beginning.

## üì• Installation Guide
Legacy Tweaks is available for multiple mod loaders, but [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) is recommended. If you are using a third-party launcher (such as Prism Launcher), it should have built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader of choice, you can simply place Legacy Tweaks into your mods folder like anything else.

## üêõ How to Report Issues
Please use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page if you are experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues. Be sure to include necessary information like your hardware/software (such as the GPU and CPU, modpack version and OS) so that it's easier for us to find issues and resolve them.
