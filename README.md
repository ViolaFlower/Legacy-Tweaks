Inspired by Adrenix's [Nostalgic Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/nostalgic-tweaks) and Wilyicaro's [Legacy4J](https://modrinth.com/mod/legacy4j), Legacy Tweaks brings many old Legacy Console Edition features to Java Edition.

Legacy Tweaks contains over 30 tweaks as of version 0.1.0, including everything from GUIs, tooltips and gameplay features.
